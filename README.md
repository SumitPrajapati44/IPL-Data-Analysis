# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis using Python  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project is a complete *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset using Python.  
The goal is to uncover meaningful *insights about teams and players* by cleaning, processing, and visualizing cricket data.  

Cricket fans often discuss “Who is the top run scorer?” or “Which team dominates the league?” — this project answers such questions with the power of *data analysis and visualization*.
